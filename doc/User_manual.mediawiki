== User Permissions ==

PRC exposes two new permissions that can be assigned to groups:

* <code>periodic-related-changes</code> - View and change the PRC notices for logged in user.
* <code>periodic-related-changes-any-user</code> - View and change the PRC notices for any user.

By default, the <code>periodic-related-changes</code> right is assigned to the <code>user</code> group so that any logged in user can view and modify their own PRC notices; the <code>periodic-related-changes-any-user</code> right is assigned to the <code>sysop</code> (often displayed as &quot;administrator&quot; on the wiki) group.
