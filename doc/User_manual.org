* User manual
** User Permissions
PRC exposes two new permissions that can be assigned to groups:
- =periodic-related-changes= - View and change the PRC notices for logged in user.
- =periodic-related-changes-any-user= - View and change the PRC notices for any user.

By default, the =periodic-related-changes= right is assigned to the =user= group so that any logged in user can view and modify their own PRC notices; the =periodic-related-changes-any-user= right is assigned to the =sysop=
