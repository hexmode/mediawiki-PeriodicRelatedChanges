* User manual

PeriodicRelatedChanges (PRC) provides your MediaWiki wiki with the ability to notify users about changes related to categories or pages they are watching on a daily or weekly basis.

** What you see when you first use PRC

When a user visits Special:PeriodicRelatedChanges on your wiki, they'll see one of three things, depending on their permission level.  The default configuration will display one of the following three pages:

- *A form to look up a user* Administrators will see this when they first visit the page. Auto-completion of the user name is provided.
- *A form to edit the the pages on a user's PRC list* Logged in users that are not administrators will see this page with their own PRC list.  Administrators will see this page once they have selected a user.
- *Permission error* Users who are not logged in will be told that they cannot access this feature.

By default, the administrator permission  (=periodic-related-changes-any-user=) is assigned to the Administrator group (=sysop=) and the user permission (=periodic-related-changes=) is assigned to anyone who is logged in (=user=).  See “[[https://github.com/hexmode/mediawiki-PeriodicRelatedChanges/blob/master/README.mediawiki#User_Permissions][User Permissions in the README]]” to understand how to change these.

** Adding to a user's PRC notifications

If you have administrative privileges, you'll be able to add notifications to any user's PRC watchlist.  When you visit the Special:PeriodicRelatedChanges page, a form field will be shown that will let you select any user that already exists in the wiki by typing their name.  Auto-completion is provided so that as soon as you type a few characters, the first few possible matches are listed.

Select a user and then hit <enter> or click “fetch”.

At this point, you'll see a list of pages that are on the user's PRC list and a form to add more pages.

** Importing a list of bulk watchers

Users that have the =periodic-related-changes-any-user= right will have the option to "Import users" listed just below "Periodic related changes" line:

[[./img/import-users.png]]

Selecting this option will produce a form that asks for a file to import.  The file is expected to be in the following format:

| Comment         | Page Title    | User1 | User2 | ... | UserX |
| Another comment | Category:Test | User2 |       |     |       |

** What counts as a related page and how to check it
A related page is defined as a page that you would get if you visited the “related changes” link on a page.  For example, clicking the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Test][releated changes]] link in the side bar of wikipedia's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categtory:Tests][Categtory:Tests]] page takes you to a page which lists all edits made by non-bot accounts to pages in the category.  The category covers a number of pages, but for the past week you can se that several edits have been made to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test][Bechdel test]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test][Drug test]] pages as well as one edit on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_slip_resistance_testing][Floor slip resistance testing]].

Non-category pages ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test][Bechdel test]], for example) will show changes on pages that are linked from or linked to the page being examined.  The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked][related changes for the Bechdel test]] page includes everything thing from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight][FiveThirtyEight]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)][npm (software)]] to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_cinema][Women's cinima]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Bechdel][Alison Bechdel]].

This means that if MediaWiki were to send out a PRC-generated email right now based on the Bechdel test page, it should include links to the pages just mentioned as well as a information on who made the changes, when the changes were made, and links to their changes.

A week ago, or a week from now the same pages would probably not be listed unless they are likely to all change every week.
