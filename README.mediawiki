= Periodic Related Changes =

Periodic Related Changes (PRC) is a MediaWiki extension to specify that a user should get the related changes for a page during a specified period of time (usually a week).

== Installation ==

Installing the PRC is straightforward.

=== Make sure Echo is installed ===

This extension relies on the [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Echo Echo extension] to send messages. Echo cannot (currently) be installed with composer, so you'll need to install it separately.

=== Fetch the extension with composer ===

If you're familiar with composer, then, to install PRC you just need to add a dependency on [https://packagist.org/packages/mwstake/periodic-related-changes mwstake/periodic-related-changes].

If you don't already have composer, you'll need to [https://getcomposer.org/download/ download it].

From the command line, run the following:

<pre class="example">php composer.phar install mwstake/periodic-related-change
</pre>
=== Update LocalSettings.php ===

Add the following line to your LocalSettings.php:

<pre class="example">wfLoadExtension( 'PeriodicRelatedChanges' );
</pre>
=== Run update.php ===

On the command line:

<pre class="example">php maintenance/update.php --quick
</pre>
=== Verify installation ===

You should see &quot;PeriodicRelatedChanges&quot; listed on your wiki's Special:Version page.

=== Setting up batched email notifications ===

Finally, if you want notifications sent in a batch on a daily or weekly basis, then it is absolutely necessary that you ensure that the auxillary script, <code>processEchoEmailBatch.php</code> is run.

You need to set up a recurring job that will run the following command at least once a day:

<pre class="example">php extensions/Echo/maintenance/processEchoEmailBatch.php
</pre>
On a Unix-derived system like Linux or OS X, this can be done with a [https://www.thesitewizard.com/general/set-cron-job.shtml cron job]. On Windows, you'll probably want to use [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj649816(v=wps.630).aspx scheduled task cmdlets in PowerShell] or [https://ss64.com/nt/schtasks.html schtasks.]

== Configuration ==

There are a few items you might want to configure for Echo and PRC. Each of the lines of code below can be put in your LocalSettings.php file.

'''PRC can send HTML email using Echo, but you need to enable it.''' ([https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgAllowHTMLEmail doc])

<source lang="php">$wgAllowHTMLEmail = true;

<source lang="php">$wgEchoEnableEmailBatch = true;
</source>
'''You can send set the default email format for your users to HTML if you'd like.''' ([https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Echo#Configuration doc])

<source lang="php">$wgDefaultUserOptions['echo-email-format'] = 'html';

'''Optionally, don't allow your users to change to the text-only email format.'''

<source lang="php">$wgHiddenPrefs[] = 'echo-email-format';

<source lang="php">$wgDefaultUserOptions['echo-subscriptions-email-periodic-related-changes'] = true;

'''Don't allow your users to turn off the notifications.'''

<source lang="php">$wgHiddenPrefs[] = 'echo-subscriptions-email-periodic-related-changes';
</source>
'''Set your user's to receive emails on a weekly basis by default.'''

<source lang="php">$wgDefaultUserOptions['echo-email-frequency'] = 7;
</source>
''The constant <code>EchoEmailFrequency::WEEKLY_DIGEST</code> is set to this number (7), but the constant can't be used in the LocalSettings.php file in some versions of MediaWiki.''

'''Optionally, don't allow your users to change to daily to emails.'''

<source lang="php">$wgHiddenPrefs[] = 'echo-email-frequency';
</source>
'''Disable (by default) un-batched, on-wiki Echo notifications for PRC.'''

<source lang="php">$wgDefaultUserOptions['echo-subscriptions-web-periodic-related-changes'] = false;
</source>
